# syndicate-farcaster-frame-starter

A starter for using https://frame.syndicate.io/ with Farcaster Frames

This repository contains two important components:
`api/syndicate-syndicate-farcaster-frame-starter.ts`: An API for serving Farcaster Frames, already integrated with the API at frame.syndicate.io
`contracts/src/SyndicateFrameNFT.sol`: An example smart contract with flexible metadata options. It's simple to modify for the metadata you want.

Fork and enjoy! Setup should only take a few minutes if your NFT contract's mint function is formatted as `mint(address to)`

DM @will on Warpcast/@WillPapper on Telegram for an API key.

Gas is sponsored up to a shared max for everyone, so please be careful in your use and leave gas for others. We'll work on self-funding options for gas soon if the sponsored gas runs out! Your minting **will go down** if gas runs out, so use this for fun experiments, not production use cases.
