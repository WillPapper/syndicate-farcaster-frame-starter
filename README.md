# syndicate-farcaster-frame-starter

A starter for using https://frame.syndicate.io/ with Farcaster Frames

This repository contains two important components:
`api/syndicate-syndicate-farcaster-frame-starter.ts`: An API for serving Farcaster Frames, already integrated with the API at frame.syndicate.io
`contracts/src/SyndicateFrameNFT.sol`: An example smart contract with flexible metadata options. It's simple to modify for the metadata you want.

Fork and enjoy! Setup should only take a few minutes if your NFT contract's mint function is formatted as `mint(address to)`
